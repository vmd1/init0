# Welcome to Byte

```bash
02:48:38 vivaan@ultimate ~ → echo welcome.txt
```

Hey! Welcome to **Byte**, my digital notepad for all things techy, where I share whatever I happen to be working on at the moment.

Byte is a place for anything, from Home Automation, to my Programming endeavours, to me trying to self-host half of Google.

Whether you’re here to learn something new, see what I’ve been building, or just take a peek into my workflow — I’m glad you stopped by.

Thanks, and I hope to see you around,
Vivaan
