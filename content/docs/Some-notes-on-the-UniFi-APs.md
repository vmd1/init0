title: 'Some Notes on the UniFi APs'
---
I recently learnt that you can control the UniFi APs LEDs via SSH, which allows you to script their control. This means that I can change what colour they are using, and schedule them to turn on and off automatically - see [here](https://init0.848226.xyz/guides/controlling-my-unifi-ap-leds-via-home-assistant/) for that. However, I though it might be worth making a small post regarding exactly what I found.

> DISCLAIMER: Proceed at your own risk. These have been tested on a U7 Pro, and are unlikely to have any catastrophic problems on other APs, but be careful regardless.

You’ll need SSH setup to do any of this first, so lets do that first.

## SSH Setup

As we aren’t scripting anything, we can use password authentication. In order to set this up, follow the below steps:

**Navigate to ‘UniFi Devices’**

**Click ‘Device Updates and Settings’ in the top left corner**

**This will open a menu. Scroll to the bottom to find the SSH section:**

Set the username and password to something of your choice.

Now we’ll connect to the APs.

## SSHing to the APs

Use the command - `ssh YOUR_USERNAME@AP_IP` - to connect:

```
 15:24:07  vivaan@Vivaans-PC  ~ ➜  ssh YOUR_USERNAME@AP_IP
The authenticity of host 'AP_IP (AP_IP)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:#############################.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'AP_IP' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

## Changing stuff up

```bash
echo 0 > /proc/gpio/led_pattern # turns off the LED
echo 1 > /proc/gpio/led_pattern # sets it to the default blue
echo 2 > /proc/gpio/led_pattern # sets it to the dull white
```

## Final thoughts

Hopefully you were able to control the colour of the LED ring on your AP, or turn it off if you wanted to. I found this quite useful as it meant I had more control over the APs, and was able to schedule them to turn on and off using Home Assistant.
